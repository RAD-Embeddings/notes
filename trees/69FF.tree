\title{py-spy: Sampling profiler}

\p{
From the [website](https://github.com/benfred/py-spy):

\blockquote{py-spy is a sampling profiler for Python programs. It lets you visualize what your Python program is spending time on without restarting the program or modifying the code in any way. py-spy is extremely low overhead: it is written in Rust for speed and doesn't run in the same process as the profiled Python program. This means py-spy is safe to use against production Python code.}
