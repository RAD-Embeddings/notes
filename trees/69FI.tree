\p{A agent is said to "defer planning" if their current \em{policy} #{\policy} is:
  \ol{
    \li{hierarchical and induces series of subgoals, #{\goal_1, \ldots \goal_n}.}
    \li{The policy is a function of a state and the current goal: #{\policy(\state\mid\action,\goal)}}
    \li{The policy is a \em{partial} function for future goals.}
