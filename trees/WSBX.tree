\title{Chain Construction for Information Firewalls}

\p{
  For example, consider the case where #{\DFA} is a long chain with a single
  accepting sink state at the end of the chain. #{\DFA'} is then generally
  partitioned into three parts:
 } 
\ol{
  \li{A chain prefix}
  \li{A large spaghetti DFA with high connectivity.}
  \li{A chain suffix ending in the accepting state.}
}

\p{
  By construction of the message passing of a RAD-encoder, the embeddings
  of the suffix can't depend on any othe other graph components.
  However, more surprisingly, as #{|\DFA'|} gets large, the embeddings for
  the prefix must also become independent to the rest of the DFA!
