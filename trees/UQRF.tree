\title{ðŸ”¬ Current Research Interests}

\p{
  My research interests span the areas of Human Robot Interaction, Formal
  Methods, Robotics, and Safety in Artificial Intelligence.
}
\p{
  During my PhD dissertation my focus was on learning formal specifications,
  e.g., automata, logic or programs, from expert demonstrations and using
  demonstrations to teach back the learned formal specifications.
}
\p{
  \strong{Post Phd:}
  Since graduating, I've had opportunities to have more hands on automotive
  experience and run a small machine learning research group. Our interests
  include, but are not limited to, data-driven prediction and understanding
  of driving scenes.

  University collaborations have resulted in work ranging from [natural language informed
  map reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10317), [using DMV crash reports
  to reconstruct driving scenarios](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.03709), [learning
  automata using natural language and expert demonstrations](https://lstar-lm.github.io/),
  and [embedding automata for use in multi-task RL](rad-embeddings.github.io/).
