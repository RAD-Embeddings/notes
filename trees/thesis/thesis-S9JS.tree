\title{Specifications from Demonstrations: Learning, Teaching, and Control}

\p{
  This is a place holder for a project I'm considering of porting my PhD thesis
  to forester potentially with the assistance of an LLM. The key goal is to make
  writing notes that build off my thesis easier as they can link, transclude, and
  reuse definitions. Furthermore, I plan to allow external contributions, so this
  enables a form of informal collaboration with other researchers.
