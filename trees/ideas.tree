\title{Idea Nursery and Random Thoughts}

\p{
This is a place to park random ideas and thoughts as they are developed.
\strong{Importantly many of these ideas might be half-baked or wrong.}
and as such \strong{do not assume I endorse them at present time...}
In fact, many ideas may be marked as TODO, indicating that only the idea
to write about the topic is here..
