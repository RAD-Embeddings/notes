\title{Emergent Deferred Planning in RAD-DFA embeddings}
\p{The message passing nature of [RAD Embeddings](69FH) inevitably results in form of deferred planning.}
\transclude{69FI}
\p{The key observation here is that a form of deferred planning is inevitable due to the fact that [the output of a fixed message passing neural network almost surely tends to a constant as the size of the graph increases.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03880). While disastrous in the general context of classification, we observe the for planning in a finite automata, this process acts like a form of deferred planning}
